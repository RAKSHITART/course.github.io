        <h2>Store Popularity Ranking</h2>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Rank stores based on customer reviews or revenue.</p>
        
        <h3>Implementation:</h3>
        <p><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> We can use sorting algorithms such as <strong>QuickSort</strong> or <strong>MergeSort</strong> to rank the stores efficiently based on customer reviews or revenue data.</p>
        
        <p>For example, QuickSort could be used to quickly sort the stores by their revenue, with the highest-ranking stores appearing first. Similarly, MergeSort can be applied if stable sorting is desired.</p>

        <h4>Example HTML Code for Ranking:</h4>
        <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;!-- List of stores with revenue data --&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Store 1 - Revenue: $10,000&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Store 2 - Revenue: $15,000&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Store 3 - Revenue: $5,000&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;!-- Here, sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort would be applied to sort these entries based on revenue --&gt;

        <h2>Wi-Fi Coverage Optimization</h2>
        <p><strong>Business Case:</strong> Ensure optimal Wi-Fi coverage throughout the mall.</p>
        
        <h3>Implementation:</h3>
        <p><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Graph algorithms like <strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong> or <strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm</strong> can be used to efficiently map Wi-Fi coverage zones, ensuring that the entire mall has sufficient coverage with minimal overlap.</p>
        
        <p>By representing the mall's layout as a graph, with each area being a node and the connection between them representing a possible Wi-Fi access point, these algorithms can help ensure that Wi-Fi coverage is optimal across all areas with minimal cost.</p>

        <h4>Example HTML Code for Mapping Wi-Fi Zones:</h4>
        <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;!-- Example representation of Wi-Fi access points and their coverage zones --&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Wi-Fi Access Point 1 - Coverage Zone: Area A, B, C&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Wi-Fi Access Point 2 - Coverage Zone: Area B, D&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Wi-Fi Access Point 3 - Coverage Zone: Area C, E&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;!-- Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm could be applied to ensure minimal coverage overlap --&gt;
